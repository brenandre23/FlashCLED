## Executive Summary

This audit documents all data sources integrated into the Conflict Early Warning Pipeline (CEWP), detailing their native resolutions, pipeline transformations, and imputation strategies for missing values. The pipeline harmonizes 21+ distinct data sources across seven thematic categories into a unified analytical framework suitable for conflict prediction modeling.

| Category | Sources | Native Resolution | Target Resolution |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Environmental | 8 | 100m – 11km, hourly/daily | H3-5, 14-day |
| Conflict & Events | 3 | Point, daily | H3-5, 14-day |
| Socio-Political | 4 | Admin-1/2, annual/quarterly | H3-5, 14-day |
| Economic | 6 | National/Market, daily/monthly | National/H3-5, 14-day |
| Infrastructure | 5 | Point/polygon, static | H3-5, static |
| Demographics | 1 | 100m, annual | H3-5, annual |
| NLP/Semantic | 3 | Event-level text / Monthly reports | H3-5, 14-day / Monthly |

## Temporal Lag Handling

The pipeline distinguishes between two independent lag mechanisms:

### Publication Lags (Data Availability)

Publication lags account for the delay between data collection and public availability. These are applied at ingestion or immediately after merge so timestamps reflect when data would actually be available in a real-time deployment.

| Source | Publication Lag | Applied At |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| GEE Environmental (ERA5, CHIRPS, MODIS, VIIRS, JRC, Dynamic World) | 14 days (1 step) | Storage (GEE window shift) |
| ACLED Hybrid NLP Drivers | 14 days (1 step) | Storage (event_date shift) |
| ACLED Conflict Counts | 14 days (1 step) | Feature engineering (post-merge) |
| Food Prices (WFP/FEWS NET) | 56 days (4 steps) | Storage (date shift) |
| CrisisWatch Reports | 14 days (1 step) | Storage (report_date shift) |

### Analytical Lags (Leakage Control)

Analytical lags ensure features only use prior-period values, preventing temporal leakage into the model. These are applied downstream in feature engineering via lag_1_step and decay transforms.

| Mechanism | Purpose | Implementation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| LAG() / shift(1) | Features use prior time step values | Applied to all model features |
| LEAD() | Targets reference future time steps | Applied to prediction targets |
| Rolling windows | Strictly historical aggregation | No overlap with target period |

**Key distinction:** Publication lag moves the timestamp to when data is available; analytical lag shifts what the model sees to a prior window. A feature can have both—e.g., GEE data has a 14-day publication lag at ingestion AND an analytical lag when used as a model feature.

---

## 1. Environmental Data

Environmental variables are aggregated from Google Earth Engine collections to H3 resolution 5 with 14-day temporal windows. Server-side processing via a Map-Reduce architecture reduces data transfer and enables efficient historical analysis.

**Publication Lag:** All GEE-sourced data uses window [T, T+13] but is stored/labeled at date T+14 to prevent temporal leakage.
